This is a test, honestly. Just trying something out.

I run a project named Quoditian, where I upload shapes and other art every day. I was told that much of it would be good for moodboards and such, so I've decided to take it farther.

My plan is to go through many words in the dictionary, styling them as I like to do, and submitting them to this, RetroFiction's Surfeit Repository of images.

I probably won't even get to a thousand, haha. In any case, I want to see how it goes. Maybe it'll reveal more about me too.
